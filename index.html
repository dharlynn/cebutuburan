												<p style="overflow-y: scroll;">
													The Marmol Cliffs are essentially two rocks that form a passageway for a river running through it. The name of the place is based on the stone walls that are smooth and shiny and have similarities to the marble stone. The word “marmol” is the Cebuano term used for marble. There are instances late in the afternoon when the sun would reflect on a particular part of the wall, which shows how smoothness of the face of the rock. More often than not the river running between the hard rock walls is shallow enough for people to wade through. But, there are also instances when the water level of the river would rise up to twenty feet, especially during heavy rainfall. During these times, the calm, shallow river would rage and endanger the lives of anyone foolhardy enough to cross through it.  The walls of the rock form a 90-degree angle providing visitors a gorge-like view. The crevices of the wall have some plant life growing in them while swallows can be seen darting around the place. You can get a ride on a motorcycle for hire to take you to the place. If you are bringing your own vehicle, it is advisable to leave it in the town since it will be necessary to go through the river to get to the cliff. It is better to hire a motorcycle in going to the cliff since the drivers know how to go through the river using its shallow parts.
